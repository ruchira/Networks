cluster_friend_graph.py - This program reads in a graph of one's Facebook
friends (previously retrieved and stored in a Python pickle file) and clusters
it using hierarchical agglomerative clustering on the Jaccard distance.  It
writes the tree(s) of friends to standard output and also writes the
tree-ordered friend matrix to a CSV file.
